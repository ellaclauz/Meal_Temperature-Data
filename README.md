# Meal_Temperature-Data
## Project Description
This repository contains dataset gotten from two polls conducted in a live session with AfroFem Coder students.
In Poll 1, we were asked to fill:
1. Name
2. Username
3. In your area right now, what is the temperature?
4. Did you provide that temperature in degrees Fahrenheit(F) or in degrees Celsuis(C)?
For Poll 2, we were asked to fill:
1. Name
2. Username
3. What is your favourite meal of the day typically?

## Project Questions
1. Rename columns
2. Cleaning of the dataset
3. Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of temperature values
4. Perform simple random sampling
5. Create a count plot to visualize the breakdown of the number of votes per meal
6. Merge the two specified dataframes and store the resulting dataframe in a new variable
7. Create a barplot to visualize the average local temperature in F of respondents grouped by preferred meal
8. Conduct hypothesis testing
